the Capstone Project (aka. Portfolio Builder #4) is the largest and most time-intensive part of your portfolio. In the last two weeks of the course, you’ll have time to work on and, in the last days, to present this project.

The Capstone Project is a self-guided research project, each student should have their own project.

In this stage, you may apply all the material covered in the course, but you can also venture beyond. e.g. you may decide to:

 - Develop a reproducible analytical workflow to provide an answer to a specific question associated with a specific type of data that you feel is not well-serviced by existing packages in R or Python.
 - Create an R or Python package that can be distributed to your colleagues that can be used to address a specific set of analytical problems.
 - Explore text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This module is available but will not be part of the core course.
 - Develop an interactive web-interface to a specific workflow, for training, exploring or reporting results. A short module is available in R for this.
 - Explore a specific algorithm in Data Science that we have not covered in the course by applying it to different data sets and describing e.g. its assumptions, uses, interpretation and limitations.

These are just some ideas – Data Science is a vast topic, and we are just scratching the surface of the most useful tools in this course. You may decide to go deeper into topics that are not included in this course, such as time series forecasting, geospatial data or financial data.
