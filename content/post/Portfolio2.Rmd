# FitBit Fitness Tracker Data
```{r fig.align="center",out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/Misk_DSI_data/private/img.jpg")
```

This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data.[dataset in kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)


## Main Question to answer in this Report :
1. How much active the users using fitbit tracker? 
2. What factors could affect the activity level of the user? 
3. Is there any improvement in the users weight? 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(plotly)
```

## read data 

```{r data}
df_fitness <- read.csv(file = '~/Documents/Misk_DSI_data/private/dailyActivity_merged.csv')

```


## Exploring the dataset 
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(df_fitness))
```

```{r}
str(df_fitness)
```


```{r}
knitr::kable(summary(df_fitness))
```

- Checking for duplicate and null values 

```{r}

noquote(paste(sum(duplicated(df_fitness)), "duplicate, GREAT"))

noquote(paste(sum(is.null(df_fitness)), "Null value, SUPER"))

```

- How many users we have in the dataset? 

```{r}
noquote(paste(length(unique(df_fitness$Id)), "Users"))
```

- How many non-zero value in Logged Activities Distance column? 

```{r}
non_zero <- sum(df_fitness$LoggedActivitiesDistance != 0)
total <- length(df_fitness$Id)
percentage <- (non_zero/total)*100
noquote(paste(round(percentage,2), "%"))
```
Since it only 3% of the column is available and we have other informative features than "LoggedActivitiesDistance" I will ignore this column.


#### Q1:How much active the users using fitbit tracker? 

- create a new dataframe having ID and Total_steps_mean and activity level
```{r , results=FALSE}
User_activity_level <- df_fitness %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(Total_steps_mean=mean(TotalSteps))
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(User_activity_level))
```

- Categorize users into 5 activity levels based on total steps
1. Sedentary
2. Low active 
3. Somewhat active
4. Active 
5. Highly active

```{r}
User_activity_level <- User_activity_level %>%
  mutate(activity_level = case_when(
    Total_steps_mean < 2000 ~ "sedentary",
    Total_steps_mean >= 2000 & Total_steps_mean < 7500 ~ "low active", 
    Total_steps_mean >= 7500 & Total_steps_mean < 10000 ~ "somewhat active", 
    Total_steps_mean >= 10000 & Total_steps_mean < 12500 ~ "active",
    Total_steps_mean >= 12500 ~ "highly active",
  ))
```

- Visualize the different user activity category
```{r echo=FALSE}
vis <- plot_ly(User_activity_level, x = ~Total_steps_mean, color = ~activity_level, type = "bar")
vis

```
Majority of users are low active type, that lead us to the next question what are the factors of low activity level? 


#### Q2: what could affect activity levels? is the weekday, month have a influnce on users?

#### Dataframe formatting:

- Changing the date format in order to extract months and days to new columns  
```{r}
df_fitness <- df_fitness %>%
   mutate(ActivityDate=as.Date(ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) 

#month column
df_fitness <- df_fitness %>%
  mutate(month = format(df_fitness$ActivityDate, "%b"))

#day column 
df_fitness <- df_fitness %>%
  mutate(day = format(df_fitness$ActivityDate, "%A"))

knitr::kable(head(df_fitness))
```

- Create a new dataframe that hold sum_activity and grouped by Id and month 

```{r, results=FALSE}
monthly_data <- df_fitness %>%
  group_by( Id,month)%>%
  summarise(sum_activity = sum(VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes,LightlyActiveMinutes,SedentaryMinutes), calories =sum(Calories))
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(monthly_data))
```

#### Now after formatting our dataframe let's see the if the month have an influence on users activity?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot1 <- ggplot(monthly_data, aes(x = month,fill = month)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8))

plot2 <- ggplot(monthly_data, aes(month,sum_activity, color=month))+geom_jitter()

plot3 <- ggplot(monthly_data, aes(month,calories, color=month))+geom_jitter()

cowplot::plot_grid(plot1, plot2,plot3,  labels = "AUTO")

```

#### let's see the if the day have an influnce on users activity?
```{r, echo=FALSE}

df_fitness <- df_fitness %>%
  mutate(sum_activity = sum(VeryActiveMinutes,FairlyActiveMinutes,LightlyActiveMinutes,SedentaryMinutes))

mean <- mean(df_fitness$TotalSteps)
totalstep_per_days <- ggplot(df_fitness, aes(day,mean))+geom_col(fill="#B1D4E0")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
sumactivity_per_days <- ggplot(df_fitness, aes(day,sum_activity))+geom_col(fill="#2E8BC0")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))

cowplot::plot_grid(totalstep_per_days, sumactivity_per_days,  labels = "AUTO")

```
From the graph we can see that weekend have drop in total steps and sum activity, which means that weekdays have an affect on the users activity level. 

#### other question could be raised here is there a prefered hours to exersice?
- By useing Hourly Intensities dataset we can answer this: 
```{r}
df_Intensities <- read.csv(file = '~/Documents/Misk_DSI_data/private/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv')
knitr::kable(head(df_Intensities))
```
- Dataframe Formatting: 
```{r}

df_Intensities$ActivityHour <- strptime(df_Intensities$ActivityHour,format="%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")

df_Intensities$Time <- format(as.POSIXct(df_Intensities$ActivityHour,format="%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S"),"%H:%M:%S")

df_Intensities$Date <- as.Date(df_Intensities$ActivityHour, format = "%m:%d:%Y")

str(df_Intensities)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df_Intensities) + 
geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = Time, y = TotalIntensity  , fill = TotalIntensity  )) +
labs(title = "Hourly Steps in a 24 hour period") +
scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue") + 
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```
From the plot it show that users tend to be more active in the hours range 5-7 much more early moring and in the evening



#### Q3: Is there any improvement in the users weight or average caleroies per day? 
- By using weight lig info dataset 

```{r}
df_weight <- read.csv(file = '~/Documents/Misk_DSI_data/private/weightLogInfo_merged.csv')

# I will subset the dataset because there is redundent column like weight in pound
df_weight = subset(df_weight, select = -c(WeightPounds, Fat, LogId))

knitr::kable(head(df_weight))
```
- Formatting the date column and creating month column 
```{r}
df_weight <- df_weight %>%
   mutate(Date=as.Date(Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) 

df_weight <- df_weight %>%
  mutate(month = format(df_weight$Date, "%m"))

str(df_weight)
```

- Create a new dataset that hold average weight for each user during the two month April and May 
```{r, results=FALSE}
weight_monthly_data <- df_weight %>%
  group_by(month, Id)%>%
  summarise(Weight_mean= mean(WeightKg), BMI_mean=mean(BMI))
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(weight_monthly_data))
```

- Visualizing users average weight and BMI during April and May, some users only have a record for the their weight and BMI in one month only  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
weight_plot <- ggplot(weight_monthly_data, aes(x = Id, y = Weight_mean, fill=month)) + 
  geom_col(position= "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Average Weight per user Id During Two Months", x = "Users")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous("Id", labels = as.character(weight_monthly_data$Id), breaks = weight_monthly_data$Id)

BMI_plot <- ggplot(weight_monthly_data, aes(x = Id, y = BMI_mean, fill=month)) + 
  geom_col(position= "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Average BMI per user Id During Two Months", x = "Users")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous("Id", labels = as.character(weight_monthly_data$Id), breaks = weight_monthly_data$Id)

library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
weight_plot / BMI_plot

```

From the plot we can see that there is no big improvement in the users weight neither their BMI.  

- Let's see users if there any increase or decrease in calories between two month 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
vis <- plot_ly(monthly_data, x = ~calories, color = ~month, type = "bar")
vis
```
From the plot we can see that April have higher measure than May it could be due to the weather.
