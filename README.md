## Hi 
This repositery contain all the files for my website. I used a hugo theme called "starter-hugo-academic" to create my website. 

Steps to get started:
- if you are runing rstudio in rrcocker image, you have to download another image called "pandoc/core"
- In Rstduio install blogdown package >> install.packages("blogdown")
- Then create a new project go to file >> new project >> new directry >> choose "Website using Blogdown" option >> specify the directry name and the theme you want you can stay with the defult theme >> create project
  - Note: The theme I used look like this[View](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/)
- Serve your site by click addins button in the toolbar and choose serve site or you can run this command >> blogdown:::serve_site() 

That's it, Congrats now you can edit your website and have fun developing your own website.
